    <h1>The User Response Questionnaire Scheme</h1>
    <p> Users are given a questionnaire at the point of installation of our extension asking direct questions
        (eg., whether they are fine with targeted ads, ...) We will run an algorithm based on the user's choice to generalize the user's choice and automatically apply it to future sites visited a challenge I can see here is to explain fairly complicated concepts to average web users (e.g., what are targeted ads, who gets their data, ...) in just a few sentences. As with S2, there may be also a challenge of identifying the features in the sites based on which the algorithm makes its decision (e.g., that a site has targeted ads)
