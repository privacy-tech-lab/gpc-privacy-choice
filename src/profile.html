    <h1>The User Profile Scheme</h1>
    <p> Users are given a questionnaire on which one of the following user profiles they identify with:
        Extremely privacy sensitive, Moderately privacy sensitive or do not really care. We run an algorithm based on the user's choice to generalize the user's choice and automatically apply to future sites
        As with S2 and S3, there may be a challenge of identifying the features in the sites based on which the algorithm makes its decision (e.g., that a site has targeted ads)
    </p>
